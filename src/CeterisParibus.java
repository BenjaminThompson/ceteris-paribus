/**
 * This program will simulate an economy by creating a population of producer-consumers that can trade with each other.
 * Initial distribution of wealth will be random. The simulated world contains 10 distinct "goods".
 * Each actor will have an ordered list of preferred goods. The price they are willing to pay or accept for those goods
 * will be directly tied to this ranking.
 * Each actor will be a producer of one good, and a consumer of all goods.
 * Rates of production and consumption among economic actors will be randomly assigned.
 * Rounds will consist of each actor producing and consuming one round's worth of their particular good,
 * then they will trade with the first available other actor any goods they have for other goods they value more.
